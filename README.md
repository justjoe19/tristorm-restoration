# TriStorm Restoration Website

## Project Overview

The TriStorm Restoration website is a professional, responsive static site designed to showcase restoration services (water, fire, storm damage, mold remediation, contents & inventory) in the Michiana area. It emphasizes 24/7 emergency response, insurance claim assistance, and a compassionate, integrity-driven approach to helping home and business owners.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Bootstrap 5.
*   **Comprehensive Service Showcase:** Detailed sections for each restoration service offered.
*   **Team Introduction:** "Meet Our Team" section with individual bios for key personnel.
*   **Customer Testimonials:** A dynamic carousel displaying positive client reviews.
*   **Contact & Emergency Form:** A Netlify-powered contact form for inquiries and emergency service requests, alongside direct contact information and a Google Maps embed.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Links to TriStorm Restoration's presence on Facebook and Instagram.
*   **SEO Optimized:** Includes meta descriptions, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and Schema.org JSON-LD for enhanced search engine visibility and rich snippets.
*   **Smooth Scrolling Navigation:** JavaScript-enhanced internal navigation with scroll offset for fixed header and accessibility features (`prefers-reduced-motion`, keyboard focus).
*   **Modern Aesthetic:** A "Modern Luxury" black and gold theme with custom typography (`Inter` and `Lexend` fonts).

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3:** For custom styling and theme application.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements and smooth scrolling.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** Front-end framework for responsive design and UI components (Navigation, Cards, Carousel, Forms, Modals).
*   **Netlify Forms:** For handling contact form submissions.

## Setup & Local Development

This is a static website, so no specific server-side setup is required beyond a web server to serve the files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd tristorm-restoration
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the site locally. For development, you might use a local development server (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension) to ensure all paths and scripts load correctly.
